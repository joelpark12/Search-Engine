# Search-Engine
Search engine made in Python for class Fall 2016
Uses Scrapy for the crawler. Search engine is no longer online. Includes an extremely basic mapping program using graph search algorithms,
such as breadth-first-search, depth-first-search, and Dijsktra's Algorithm. The crawler supports breadth or depth first searching. The 
Pagerank algorithm is also implemented.
Known issues: Crawler is slightly slower than it should be. This is a result of the way I did error checking and unfamiliarity with Scrapy.
